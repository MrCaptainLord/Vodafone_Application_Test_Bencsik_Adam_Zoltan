# Vodafone_Application_Test_Bencsik_Adam_Zoltan

The application uses yarn as package manager, so the following commands must be run in a terminal from the project directory:
1. yarn // downloads the dependencies
2. yarn start // starts the application on default port 3000

Comments about the endpoints can be found in the user.api.ts file.
